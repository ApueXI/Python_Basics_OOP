# Static methods = A method that belong to a class rather than any object from that class (instance) A #
#                  Usually used for general utility functions

# Instance methods = Best for operations on instances of the class (objects)
# #Static methods = Best for utility functions that do not need access to class data
# from my undersatding, we use classmethod if ww want to use the calss variables
